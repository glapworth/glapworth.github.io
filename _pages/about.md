I find it so difficult to write in a blogging style since using the first person rather than writing around it is a bit alien to my brain. 
This blog is my way of attempting to get back into writing having been on a hiatus for a number of years.  I've always fancied having a blog
but finding the time to write, and thinking of things to write is often difficult - I suspect that is also true of most people.

My career began when I was around 8 years old.  My dad had bought a Commodore Amiga and used to bring games home to play. I learned how to use
it whilst he was out at work, and found his stash of Leisure Suit Larry games.  Oh the fun times I used to have trying to figure out how to get
Larry out of the trouble he often found himself in (I remember asking my mum what a prophylactic was - and she was as confused as me! - 
we're from England you see).

After playing Larry, and all the other games I could, I began to get a nervous excitement that pushed me to understand how computers worked.  How could this whirring machine give me so much fun, and how do I 
ask it to give me some more?  I found the manuals for the computer and began reading through them, but at the age of 8, most of the documentation
was out of my grasp. 

A friend of mine had a Amstrad CPC464 and a collection of books.  I remember wondering over to his house to play, only to sit and read his books whilst
trying to figure out what the hell BASIC was.  I wrote my first programs on paper at home, and rushed over to type them out on his 
computer only to be delighted when they ran - and equally delighted when they didn't. Everything at that age was a puzzle to me, and the more I solved
them, the better I'd get a solving more.

I programed the ZX Specturm, BBC Micro, Acorn Archemedies (ARM!), PC, anything I could find on my travels -  I didn't have a home computer to myself until
I was 16.  The rush I had when I wrote and ran code was just fantastic.  I remember having my PS/2 (I think it was a model 55 - but don't quote me on that), and installing
Windows 3.11.  I remember the first time I installed OS/2 Warp. BeOS. Linux. BSD.  Every new operating system caused a further explosion in my head. WOW!

So here I am, almost 40. I've been programming now over 30 years by my own admission. I'm a software engineer by trade (of course). My proudest achievement
is my happy family, I have a wonderful wife and three brilliant children. I also play the Ukulele.  

I wonder what sort of things I'll post in the blog?  

Happy hacking!
