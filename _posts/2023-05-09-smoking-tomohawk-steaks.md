I've recently taken the plunge and bought a new BBQ Smoker.  It's a Oklahoma Joe Highlander, truly a magnificent
piece of hardware am I am very impressed by it.  I'll go into more detail in a later post discussing the pros and cons 
and the different mods I either have made or plan to make to it, but for now, I wanted to discuss the first cook I did.

Last Thursday, for my Birthday, I cooked some delicious Tomahawk steaks, and I'm excited to share my recipe with you. 
If you're not familiar with Tomahawk steaks, they're usually around 32 ounces and are a great choice for a special 
occasion or a treat for yourself.

Firstly, I dry-brined the steak for up to 4 hours, using around half a teaspoon of salt on each side of the steak. 
This step helps to season the meat, and the salt draws out some of the moisture, which makes for a more flavorful and 
tender steak.  Since this cut is so large, it really does make sense to do this.  I used salt flakes, but you can use 
rock salt or kosher salt if you prefer.

Next, I applied a very liberal coating of extra virgin olive oil to the steak, followed by a dry rub.
You can use whatever blend of spices you like, but I recommend finding a recipe that complements the rich, beefy flavor 
of the steak.  Last year, we took a family holiday to the USA, and I picked up the house seasoning from the Beef 
Palace, Huntington CA.  We tried it a few times on the BBQ during the holiday and found it tasted awesome. 

I got my OK Joe up to a temperature of around 110C and kept it there for the duration of the cook. Once the smoker was 
up to level and ready, I put the steak in the cooking chamber and monitored the internal temperature of the steak 
until it reached around 43C.

At this point, I removed the steak from the smoker and placed it directly over the coals to sear it for its final cook. 
I brought the steak up to 54C for medium-rare or 50C for slightly rarer. Remember, the steak will continue to cook 
for a few minutes after you take it off the grill, so make sure to take it off a few degrees before your desired level 
of doneness.

Finally, I let the steak rest for as long as I could handle it. Resting the meat allows the juices to redistribute,
resulting in a more tender and flavorful steak. After resting, I sliced the steak and served it with some salad and 
chips along with a large glass of red wine.

It was such an awesome thing to cook!
